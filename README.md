Zeegaree
========

Stopwatch, Timer and Time Management

## Where does it work?
Zeegaree was developed to work with desktop version of Ubuntu Unity in mind but it also should work on other Linux distros.

## Dependencies
**Zeegaree needs few packages in order to work properly.**
These are:
- libqt4-sql-sqlite
- python-pyside
- gir1.2-unity
- gir1.2-notify
- python-dbus
- maybe something more, let me know

## How to run it?
1. Download [zip with all the files](https://github.com/mivoligo/Zeegaree/archive/master.zip) 
2. Unpack it somewhere
3. From your terminal run: `python path-to-zeegaree.py`
